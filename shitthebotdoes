List of things I want the bot to do?
every 50 hours the token expires (selenium?)
1. count all the users and there messages from start of stream to endpoint (myendpoint is when I stop the bot)
2. evey hour it gives a status report in stream
-- 1st will get encoraging statment
--2nd will get a challenge
--3rd will get little brothered
--dead last will be ban
also the bot has a hidden function that deducts .5 points for spam worth comments
also a hidden function for using in house emjoie, emotes and channelpoint .25 bonus per comments
then at the end of the stream a short clip of the winners inserting the names and place of each winner 
then changing th 1st place winner inthe old "perfect stranger" but if it is an repeat we add x2+1 etc
